## About DPUse

[DPUse](https://www.dpuse.app) (Data Positioning & Use) is an in-browser application that positions your data for use through three core activities: sourcing, contextualising, and publishing.

**Sourcing** uses a library of [Connectors](https://www.dpuse.app/connectors) to establish [Connections](https://www.dpuse.app) to applications, databases, file stores, and curated datasets; these connections are subsequently used to configure structured [Data Views](https://www.dpuse.app) from the underlying sources.

**Contextualising** extracts chronological events from those [Data Views](https://www.dpuse.app) and maps them into comprehensive [Context Models](https://www.dpuse.app). This gives the DPUse Engine the structural framework needed to generate deterministic transactions, facts, or observations.

**Publishing** uses a library of [Presenters](https://www.dpuse.app) to render standard [Presentations](https://www.dpuse.app) immediately using the contextualised data; additionally, [Cookbooks](https://www.dpuse.app) of [Recipes](https://www.dpuse.app) let you build Data Apps using your preferred tools.

In addition, DPUse provides [Tools](https://www.dpuse.app) used by the application, and you can use them to construct connectors and presenters.

## Introduction

...

Consider TanStack Markdown library for replacing Marked at some future date.

<!-- OPENING_END -->

A library that wraps the Marked markdown parser, giving DPUse a single, cloud-managed markdown renderer shared by dpuse-app and any presenter that needs one.

## Features

- 🚀 **Fast Markdown Parsing**: with Marked
- ☁️ **Cloud-Managed**: automatically updates new instances and notifies running instances of available updates
- 🧑‍💻 **Implemented in TypeScript**: fully coded in TypeScript

<!-- DEPENDENCY_LICENSES_START -->

## Dependency Licenses

License data is updated each time `npm run document` is run, using [license-checker](https://github.com/RSeidelsohn/license-checker-rseidelsohn). The following table lists every package whose code, styles or assets are included in this project's build, as recorded by the build itself. Modules loaded at run time are not included; each documents its own. These dependencies have been checked and confirmed to use MIT, all of which allow commercial use. All are used unmodified, so any licence conditions that apply only to modified versions are not triggered. Developers cloning this repository should independently verify development dependencies.

| Dependency                                         | Version | License(s) | Document                                                 |
| :------------------------------------------------- | :-----: | :--------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)       | 18.0.14 | MIT        | [LICENSE](licenses/downloads/marked@18.0.14-LICENSE.txt) |
| [turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown) |  7.2.4  | MIT        | [LICENSE](licenses/downloads/turndown@7.2.4-LICENSE.txt) |

### Dependency Tree

The dependency tree below shows how each package in the table above is reached — direct and transitive — along with its installed version, release date, and update status. A package that does not ship itself, such as one whose parts are bundled separately, is left out and what ships beneath it is shown in its place. Packages flagged ❗ have a newer version available; ⚠️ indicates a package that hasn't been updated in the last 6 months or longer. Neither flag necessarily indicates a problem: we let new releases stabilise before upgrading, and some packages are mature and stable (have limited or no dependencies), so they require no active development.

- **[marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)** 18.0.14 — this month: 2026-09-22 → latest: 18.1.0 — this month: 2026-10-05 ❗
- **[turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown)** 7.2.4 — 6 mths ago: 2026-04-03

## Bundle Analysis

This report is updated with each release, from the bundle the release builds, using [Sonda](https://sonda.dev/), which analyses final source maps to reveal the actual effects of tree-shaking and minification rather than relying on pre-build estimates.

_Note: Sonda's Vite reports currently exclude CSS files, since Vite does not generate source maps for CSS._

| Chunk/Module/File                                             | Composition                                  |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |

| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(bundler output, whitespace & JSON)   | `█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░` 7.2% · 4.9 kB         |

Bars show each row's share of its output file.

(bundler output, whitespace & JSON) = bytes Sonda can't trace to a source file: whitespace (indentation and line breaks), code the bundler generates (region comments, the combined import/export lines, its small runtime helper and wrappers), and imported JSON such as `config.json`, which the bundler doesn't map. The JSON and the generated code are real bytes that ship; the whitespace mostly disappears once compressed.

This project is working towards the [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev) Passing badge, a self-certification covering security policy, vulnerability reporting, build processes, code quality, and more. Currently the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://scorecard.dev) provides an independent automated assessment of the project's security practices and is an ongoing area of improvement.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. Use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/dpuse/dpuse-tool-marked-markdown-parser/security/advisories/new) instead. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the full disclosure policy, contact details, and expected response times.
