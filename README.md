# Data Positioning Marked Tool

Consider TanStack Markdown library for replacing Marked at some future date.

A library that wraps the Marked markdown parser, giving DPUse a single, cloud-managed markdown renderer shared by dpuse-app and any presenter that needs one.

## Features

- 🚀 **Fast Markdown Parsing**: with Marked
- ☁️ **Cloud-Managed**: automatically updates new instances and notifies running instances of available updates
- 🧑‍💻 **Implemented in TypeScript**: fully coded in TypeScript

## About DPUse

DPUse (Data Positioning & Use) is an in-browser application that positions your data for use through three core activities: sourcing, contextualising, and publishing.

**Sourcing** uses a library of [Connectors](https://www.dpuse.app/connectors) to establish [Connections](https://www.dpuse.app) to applications, databases, file stores, and curated datasets; these connections are subsequently used to configure structured [Data Views](https://www.dpuse.app) from the underlying sources.

**Contextualising** extracts chronological events from those [Data Views](https://www.dpuse.app) and maps them into comprehensive [Context Models](https://www.dpuse.app). This gives the DPUse Engine the structural framework needed to generate deterministic transactions, facts, or observations.

**Publishing** uses a library of [Presenters](https://www.dpuse.app) to render standard [Presentations](https://www.dpuse.app) immediately using the contextualised data; additionally, [Cookbooks](https://www.dpuse.app) of [Recipes](https://www.dpuse.app) let you build Data Apps using your preferred tools.

In addition, DPUse provides [Tools](https://www.dpuse.app) used by the application, and you can use them to construct connectors and presenters.

## Dependency Licenses

License data is updated each time `npm run document` is run, using [license-checker](https://github.com/RSeidelsohn/license-checker-rseidelsohn). The following table lists all production dependencies. These dependencies (including transitive ones) have been checked and confirmed to use CC0-1.0, BSD-2-Clause, or MIT — all permissive, commercially-friendly licenses. Users of the uploaded library are covered by these checks; developers cloning this repository should independently verify development dependencies.

### Dependency Tree

The dependency tree below lists every package in this project — direct and transitive — along with its installed version, release date, and update status. Packages flagged ❗ have a newer version available; ⚠️ indicates a package that hasn't been updated in the last 6 months or longer. Neither flag necessarily indicates a problem: we let new releases stabilise before upgrading, and some packages are mature and stable (have limited or no dependencies), so they require no active development.

- **[marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked)** 18.0.14 — this month: 2026-09-22
- **[turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown)** 7.2.4 — **5 months** ago: 2026-04-03
    - **[@mixmark-io/domino](https://github.com/mixmark-io/domino)** 2.2.0 — **29 months** ago: 2024-04-06 ⚠️

## Bundle Analysis

This report is updated with each release, from the bundle the release builds, using [Sonda](https://sonda.dev/), which analyses final source maps to reveal the actual effects of tree-shaking and minification rather than relying on pre-build estimates.

_Note: Sonda's Vite reports currently exclude CSS files, since Vite does not generate source maps for CSS._

(bundler output, whitespace & JSON) = bytes Sonda can't trace to a source file: whitespace (indentation and line breaks), code the bundler generates (region comments, the combined import/export lines, its small runtime helper and wrappers), and imported JSON such as `config.json`, which the bundler doesn't map. The JSON and the generated code are real bytes that ship; the whitespace mostly disappears once compressed.

This project is working towards the [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev) Passing badge, a self-certification covering security policy, vulnerability reporting, build processes, code quality, and more. Currently the [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://scorecard.dev) provides an independent automated assessment of the project's security practices and is an ongoing area of improvement.

### Reporting Vulnerabilities

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities. Use [GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/dpuse/dpuse-tool-marked-markdown-parser/security/advisories/new) instead. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the full disclosure policy, contact details, and expected response times.
